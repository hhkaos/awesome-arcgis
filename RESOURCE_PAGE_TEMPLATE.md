Please find the [ArcGIS Experts on this topic using this tool](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=TOPIC):

[![ArcGIS Experts Tool Screenshot](https://github.com/esri-es/arcgis-experts/blob/master/assets/imgs/arcgis-experts-tool.png?raw=true)](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=TOPIC):

They don't work on the support team and some may even not work at Esri,
but they are opening some projects and sharing insights related to this
technology so we recommend you to follow them.
