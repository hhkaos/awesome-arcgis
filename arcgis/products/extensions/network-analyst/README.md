## Introduction

Network Analyst is an Extension available for [ArcGIS Pro](../../arcgis-desktop/arcgis-pro/README.md), [ArcMap](../../arcgis-desktop/arcmap-arccatalog/README.md) and [ArcGIS Server](../../arcgis-enterprise/arcgis-server/README.md) to answer questions like:

* What is the quickest way to get from point A to point B?
* What houses are within five minutes of our fire stations?
* What market areas does our business cover?
* What is the nearest coffee shop from my current location?
* Which patrol cars can respond the quickest to these incidents?
* How can we route our fleet of delivery vehicles to minimize overall transportation costs and improve customer service?
* Where should we open a new branch of our business to maximize market share?
* Our company needs to downsize, and which stores should we close to maintain the most overall demand?
* What are live or historical traffic conditions like, and how do they affect my network analysis results?
* etc.

## People you should know

Please find the ArcGIS Experts (story tellers and developers) on this topic here: [https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=Network%20Analyst](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=Network%20Analyst)

They don't work on the support team and some may even not work at Esri,
but they are opening some projects and sharing insights related to this
technology so we recommend you to follow them.
