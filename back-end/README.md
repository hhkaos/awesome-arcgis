## Introduction
As a backend developer you will have three options to interact with ArcGIS:

1. Though the cloud using [ArcGIS Online](../arcgis/products/arcgis-online/README.md)
2. Though an on-premise infrastructure using [ArcGIS Enterprise](../arcgis/products/arcgis-enterprise/README.md)
3. Or by and hybrid approach

Anyhow you should understand how [ArcGIS REST APIs](../esri/open-vision/open-specifications/arcgis-rest-api/README.md) works in order to be able to:
* Geoenrich your data
* Run spatial analysis
* Find geolocated data
* Store content in the cloud
* Manage an ArcGIS Organization
* etc.

You will find some libraries built on [ruby, python and nodejs](technologies/README.md).

We also recommend you to read the [best practices](best-practices/README.md).

You will probably also interested on understanding some of our [open specifications](../esri/open-vision/open-specifications/README.md)
in order to be able to read and interpret some content.
