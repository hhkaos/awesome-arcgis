            <description><![CDATA[<h1>About</h1>
<p>When we started this project we had in mind to mainly help developers, but later on we realized that it was also helpful for other users with different backgrounds. That&#39;s the reason because of <a href="https://github.com/hhkaos/awesome-arcgis/blob/master/SUMMARY.md">the structure</a> of this project has a &quot;developer taste&quot;.</p>
<p>In this page I will try to explain why we started this <strong>collaborative project</strong> and the objective that it pursues.</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Sometimes we hear <strong>that people new to ArcGIS</strong> find difficult to understand the technology because there are too much information about Esri and ArcGIS, but also because it is <a href="../esri/README.md#websites">spread in many  websites</a>.</p>
<p>Some people also told us the documentation is tough to read because sometimes it assumes you already have some background on GIS and/or ArcGIS (and that&#39;s not always true).</p>
<p>But even if you are already familiar with ArcGIS you might also suffer sometimes trying to find some documentation, resources, ... related to a product or technology, and that&#39;s because in Esri we have <strong>more than 150 different sites on different subdomains</strong> (with a few <a href="https://www.google.es/search?q=site%3Aesri.com+OR+site%3Aarcgis.com">thousands of pages</a>).</p>
<p>Not even the search engines available<sup><a href="#search-engines">1</a></sup>
. can offer a fulfilling solution to this problem, because not everything is ready to be indexed (for example some: community content or international distributor resources), and even if they could, they probably would not be able to properly structure and curate their results.</p>
<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>That&#39;s why we decided to build this project, a collection of <em><a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md">awesome lists</a></em> for ArcGIS developers, a place where anyone could find <strong>one page per technology or topic</strong> with the best official but also the best community resources we know, included the localized ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example awesome pages</strong>: <a href="../arcgis/products/web-appbuilder/developer-edition/README.md">Web AppBuilder Developer Edition</a>, <a href="../arcgis/products/configurable-apps/README.md">Configurable Apps</a>, <a href="../esri/open-vision/open-specifications/web-map/README.md">Web Map Spec</a>, <a href="../arcgis/developers/profiles/front-end/technologies/leaflet/README.md">Esri-Leaflet</a>, <a href="../arcgis/products/arcgis-desktop/arcgis-pro/README.md">ArcGIS Pro and it&#39;s SDK</a>, <a href="../arcgis/developers/profiles/mobile/technologies/android/README.md">Runtime SDK for Android</a>, <a href="../esri/open-vision/open-specifications/arcgis-rest-api/README.md">REST APIs</a>, etc,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are working closely with many <a href="https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/">ArcGIS experts</a> to collect the best information available for each topic, but <strong>anyone is welcome to contribute</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/hhkaos/awesome-arcgis/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">learn how</a>).</p>
<p>Our goals are to make it easier for anyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>To get started developing with ArcGIS</li>
<li>To have a better picture of the state of the art on any topic (with all its available resources)</li>
<li>To stay updated</li>
<li>To extend his knowledge about the ArcGIS platform and it possibilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>We really hope this project helps you to become an <a href="https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/">ArcGIS experts</a> in the ArcGIS Platform.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The ArcGIS platform has been designed mainly to be used directly by organizations, this is why it provides a user management system integrated, it use the identities to ensure privacy and security.</p>
<p>So, when we talk about name users at ArcGIS we are talking about users for <a href="../account-types/README.md">organization accounts</a> for <a href="../products/arcgis-online/README.md">ArcGIS Online</a> or <a href="../products/arcgis-enterprise/README.md">ArcGIS Enterprise</a>.</p>
<p>There are two levels of name users (level 1 and level 2) and they have different costs.</p>
<h2>Integration using OAuth 2.0</h2>
<p>Any developer can add login button (as any other &quot;social login&quot;) to enable an user with an ArcGIS account to <a href="https://github.com/esri-es/arcgis-oauth-samples">login to his app using oAuth, read more</a>.</p>
<h2>Name User Levels Guide</h2>
<p>Extracted from: <a href="https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2016/12/20/your-guide-to-named-user-levels/">Your Guide to Named User Levels
</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why a New Named User Level?</strong></p>
<p>Many of you have asked for the ability to share private information more broadly with others in your organization. We realize that you create a lot of valuable information products—analysis results, dashboards, maps, and more—that others need to view and use in order to make decisions.</p>
<p>This new Level 1 Named User is in addition to the Level 2 Named User (formerly called Named User) and is a cost-effective way to share those important information products in your organization without giving up control over what information is seen by whom and how it is used. And all of this is accomplished using the same sharing workflows that you already have in place.</p>
<p><strong>What Can This New Level 1 Named Users Do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>View private content shared within your organization</li>
<li>Participate in private groups (invitation only)</li>
<li>Access subscription and premium ArcGIS content that is shared as part of a map, scene, or app</li>
<li>Use configured apps (read only)</li>
<li>Access basemaps, search for content, and use geosearch</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Can This New Level 1 Named Users Not Do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create any kind of content*</li>
<li>Edit or make new map</li>
<li>Share content to their organization or the public</li>
<li>Create groups</li>
<li>Manage other users, groups, or content</li>
<li>Perform analysis</li>
<li>How Does This New Level 1 Named User Affect What I Have Today?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ArcGIS Enterprise users</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With ArcGIS Enterprise you still have the same number of User Entitlements, which are now called Level 2 Named Users and which have the same capabilities (including ArcGIS apps) as before. As part of your maintenance benefit, we are also including additional 30 Level 1 Named Users in ArcGIS Enterprise Standard and Advanced.</li>
<li>You can purchase additional Level 1 and Level 2 Named Users at any time and add them to your ArcGIS Enterprise instance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ArcGIS Online users</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All your existing Named Users have been automatically converted to Level 2 Named User. You also now have the ability to purchase additional Level 1 Named Users and add them to your ArcGIS Online subscription, just like you already can purchase additional Level 2 Named Users to expand your subscription.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ArcGIS Desktop users</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your named User Entitlement is now referred to as a Level 2 Named User. There are no changes to the functionality you currently have access to.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ArcGIS App users</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Existing ArcGIS App users will continue to use their apps as they have been using them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that you can’t convert your current named users (Level 2) in your ArcGIS Online subscription or ArcGIS Enterprise instance to Level 1 Named Users until you’ve purchased and added Level 1 accounts to your ArcGIS Enterprise instance or ArcGIS Online subscription. Once you’ve purchased Level 1 Named Users, you can change Named User Level designations between members. ArcGIS Enterprise and ArcGIS Online administrators can still configure a Level 2 Named User and create custom roles and define privileges, just like they have been able to do.</p>

<p>Each day we realize that been able to work offline with our mobile, tablet or
desktop devices is more important, that why we offer you the chance to build
applications that could work with maps &amp; GIS without internet connection.</p>
<p>There are many options to solve problems when you need apps to work offline, here
you will find many of those.</p>
<h2>Developer technologies</h2>
<h3>Native apps</h3>
<p>If you are a <a href="../../arcgis/developers/profiles/mobile/README.md">mobile developer</a> or a <a href="../../arcgis/developers/profiles/desktop/README.md">desktop developer</a>
you have all our native Runtimes and SDKs and some builders to build you own
custom apps.</p>
<p>In case you are not a developer or you want to build an app quickly you also
have <a href="../products/appstudio/README.md">AppStudio Standard</a> and <a href="../products/survey123/README.md">Survey123</a>
that will help you build offline apps.</p>
<p>And in case you don&#39;t need to but to build a custom or branded app you may also
consider to use <a href="http://www.esri.com/products/collector-for-arcgis">Collector for ArcGIS</a>.</p>
<h3>Web apps</h3>
<p>But if you are a web developer and you don&#39;t need a powerful GIS SDK to build
app you can also build it using <a href="../../developers/profiles/front-end/technologies/phonegap/README.md">phonegap</a>.</p>
<p>We also encourage you to take a look to the <a href="../../arcgis/developers/profiles/front-end/technologies/dojo/offline-editor-js/README.md">offline-editor-js project</a> which is an ArcGIS JavaScript
library for handling offline editing and tiling.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a responsive app to collect points oflline you could take
a look to <a href="https://github.com/Esri/geoform-template-js">GeoForm</a>, a web app which can make the job (but it offline functionality
  <a href="https://community.esri.com/groups/survey123/blog/2015/09/04/survey123-collector-and-geoform-a-quick-comparison">is limited</a>).</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t know already, you should learn about <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">progressive web apps</a> in order to be
learn how to build reliable, fast and engaging apps even when you have no
Internet connection.</p>
<p>Google is doing a great job spreading the word about it benefits.</p>

<h2>Prepare content to be consumed offline</h2>
<p>When you are developing an offline app you can follow two main patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Services pattern</strong>: Best for supporting a large number of users, this pattern allows multiple offline users to edit the same data layers and sync edits later, when online.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop pattern</strong>: Best for supporting applications with read-only data that requires periodic updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/take-maps-offline.htm">Take maps offline with ArcGIS Online</a></p>
<h3>Patterns</h3>
<h4>Services pattern</h4>
<p>The services pattern is best for supporting a large number of users. This pattern allows multiple offline users to edit the same data layers and sync edits later, when online.</p>
<p>For operational data, you can use a sync-enabled feature service from ArcGIS for Server, ArcGIS Online, or Portal for ArcGIS to generate the geodatabase for offline use. Through the synchronization process, you can control whether a user can upload their changes, download others&#39; changes, or both. This allows the application to have an up-to-date view of the data. When more than one user is editing the same feature and the edits conflict, the last edit synchronized to the service overrides the others.</p>
<p>In one workflow, sometimes referred to as a pre-planned workflow, you generate the geodatabase once and load it onto your users&#39; devices. This workflow requires you to <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/net/10-2/arcgis/developers/profiles/desktop/guide/create-an-offline-map.htm#ESRI_SECTION3_7BBF009905B847569B3E8B61A1991001">register a geodatabase</a>.</p>
<p>For basemap data, ArcGIS tiled map services and ArcGIS Online basemaps allow for the on-demand creation of tile caches, letting you take your basemaps offline.</p>
<p><strong>Create a basemap from a tiled service (download a basemap)</strong>: An offline copy of
tiled map services can be requested so that a basemap is available when the
application is working in an offline environment. These copies can be downloaded
in the form of a <a href="../../content/data-storage/file-formats/tpk/README.md">tile package (.tpk file)</a> or compact cache by using the API.</p>
<h4>Desktop pattern</h4>
<p>This is the best for supporting applications with read-only data that requires
periodic updates.</p>
<p>You can use ArcGIS for Desktop to include features, tabular data, tile caches,
network datasets for directions and locators in your offline app.</p>
<p>Learn more: <a href="http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/map/working-with-arcmap/creating-arcgis-runtime-content.htm">Create ArcGIS Runtime content using ArcGIS Desktop</a></p>
<p>To include operational data in your offline app generate a geodatabase (using
ArcGIS for Desktop).</p>
<p><strong>Create a basemap using ArcGIS for Desktop</strong>: When you create a basemap using ArcGIS for Desktop, you can set the format, tiling schemes, and levels of detail.</p>
<p>For details, see the online ArcGIS help topics:
<a href="http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/map/working-with-arcmap/how-to-create-a-tile-package.htm">How to create a tile package</a> and <a href="http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/map/working-with-arcmap/about-tile-packages.htm">About tile packages</a>.</p>

<h1>IKONOS</h1>
<p>IKONOS is a commercial Earth observation satellite, and was the first to collect publicly available high-resolution imagery at 1- and 4-meter resolution. It collected multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) imagery. The capability to observe Earth via space-based telescope has been called &quot;one of the most significant developments in the history of the space age&quot;, and IKONOS brought imagery rivaling that of military spy satellites to the commercial market. IKONOS imagery began being sold on 1 January 2000, and the spacecraft was retired in 2015. | <em>Source:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikonos">wikipedia</a></em>.</p>

<h1>QuickBird</h1>
<p>QuickBird was a high-resolution commercial earth observation satellite, owned by DigitalGlobe launched in 2001 and decayed in 2015. It was the first satellite in a constellation of three scheduled to be in orbit by 2008. QuickBird used Ball Aerospace&#39;s Global Imaging System 2000 (BGIS 2000). The satellite collected panchromatic (black and white) imagery at 61 centimeter resolution and multispectral imagery at 2.44- (at 450 km) to 1.63-meter (at 300 km) resolution, as orbit altitude is lowered during the end of mission life. | <em>Source:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBird">wikipedia</a></em>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There are two main ways to store and manage any type of data in a computer, here you will learn about different ways to store geographic information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./databases/README.md">Using databases</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="./file-formats/README.md">Using files</a></strong> (binary or plain text)</li>
</ul>
<h2>ArcGIS storage</h2>
<p>The benefits from storing content inside ArcGIS are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Been able to run spatial analysis inside the platform</li>
<li>Consume your data from any <a href="../../products/README.md">ArcGIS product</a></li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: If you are building an app using ArcGIS we recommended you to store your content in an ArcGIS storage because that way you will get the most of the APIs and SDKs</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>ArcGIS services</h2>
<p>Long time ago both the applications an the source code use to live in the same machine. Nowadays software architectures have evolved and distributed software is very common.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why ArcGIS provide many service type to be able to access to all the content stored in your databases or files.</p>
<p>Learn more about <a href="./service-types/README.md">ArcGIS service types</a> and how you can benefit from them. </p>
<h2>Additional resources</h2>
<p>Probably not all the resources are in this list, please use the <a href="https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-search/">ArcGIS Search</a> tool looking for: <a href="https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-search/?search=&quot;storage&quot;&amp;utm_campaign=awesome-list&amp;utm_source=awesome-list&amp;utm_medium=page">&quot;storage&quot;</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There are two main ways to store and manage any type of data in a computer, here you will learn about different ways to store geographic information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./databases/README.md">Using databases</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="./file-formats/README.md">Using files</a></strong> (binary or plain text)</li>
</ul>
<h2>ArcGIS storage</h2>
<p>The benefits from storing content inside ArcGIS are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Been able to run spatial analysis inside the platform</li>
<li>Consume your data from any <a href="../../products/README.md">ArcGIS product</a></li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: If you are building an app using ArcGIS we recommended you to store your content in an ArcGIS storage because that way you will get the most of the APIs and SDKs</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>ArcGIS services</h2>
<p>Long time ago both the applications an the source code use to live in the same machine. Nowadays software architectures have evolved and distributed software is very common.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why ArcGIS provide many service type to be able to access to all the content stored in your databases or files.</p>
<p>Learn more about <a href="./service-types/README.md">ArcGIS service types</a> and how you can benefit from them. </p>
<h2>Additional resources</h2>
<p>Probably not all the resources are in this list, please use the <a href="https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-search/">ArcGIS Search</a> tool looking for: <a href="https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-search/?search=&quot;storage&quot;&amp;utm_campaign=awesome-list&amp;utm_source=awesome-list&amp;utm_medium=page">&quot;storage&quot;</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When an application needs to support simultaneous editing of users, work with large volumes of data, etc. we would want to use databases capable of performing advanced functionalities with spatial data, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./enterprise-geodatabase/README.md">Esri Enterprise GeoDatabases</a></li>
<li>Postgre</li>
<li>SQL Server</li>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction to Esri Geodatabases</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: no every Esri Geodatabase type run on top of a DBMS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A geodatabase is a based on the relational database model and is allows you to store GIS information in one large file, which can contain multiple point, polygon, and/or polyline layers. It is a less “messy” way of organizing data than having multiple <a href="../shapefile/README.md">shapefiles</a> in multiple folders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Geodatabases also allows you to set up a topology, store rasters, add domains or geometric networks, which you can’t do with shapefiles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three types of geodatabases (GDB):</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>CSV is a format for tabular data, and where you can find attributes that contain geographic information, usually in the form of X and Y coordinates (or latitude and longitude).</p>
<p>The main advantage of this format is that they can be processed quickly and take up very little space.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">From Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CSV file format is not fully standardized. The basic idea of separating fields with a comma is clear, but that idea gets complicated when the field data may also contain commas or even embedded line-breaks. CSV implementations may not handle such field data, or they may use quotation marks to surround the field. Quotation does not solve everything: some fields may need embedded quotation marks, so a CSV implementation may include escape characters or escape sequences.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: A collection of various types of GIS datasets held in a file system folder.(This is the recommended native data format for ArcGIS stored and managed in a file system folder.)</p>
<p><strong>Number of users</strong>: Single user and small workgroups:many readers or one writer per feature dataset, stand-alone feature class, or table. Concurrent use of any specific file eventually degrades for large numbers of readers.</p>
<p><strong>Storage format</strong>: Each dataset is a separate file on disk. A file geodatabase is a file folder that holds its dataset files.</p>
<p><strong>Size limits</strong>: One TB for each dataset. Each file geodatabase can hold many datasets. The 1 TB limit can be raised to 256 TB for extremely large image datasets. Each feature class can scale up to hundreds of millions of vector features per dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Versioning support</strong>: Only supported as a geodatabase for clients who post updates using checkout and check-in and as a client to which updates can be sent using one-way replication.</p>
<p><strong>Platforms</strong>: Cross-platform.</p>
<p><strong>Security and permissions</strong>: Operating file system security.</p>
<p><strong>Database administration tools</strong>: File system management.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: You can optionally store data in a read-only compressed format to reduce storage requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>GeoCSV is a recent extension of the CSV file format with an optional extension of geometry. It takes little space and is easy to share.</p>
<p>As the shapefile, it can be accompanied by auxiliary files: .prj (Spatial Reference System), .csvt (field type information), csvz (compression format).</p>
<p>Variants:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The WKT option</strong>: stores the constructor in a single column of type String, for example &quot;POINT (-4.5454 45.2211)&quot;, which means -4.5454 west and 45.2211 north (longitude / latitude). This option supports the geometry types Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon and even GeometryCollection and ARCs.</li>
<li><strong>The option &quot;Point (X / Y)&quot;</strong>: can only store points. This type of point geometry is stored in two columns: longitude, latitude (x / y). Example for two columns of coordinates lon and lat is &quot;8.8249; 47.2274&quot;</li>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GeoJSON</strong> is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. It is based on JSON, the JavaScript Object Notation.</p>
<p>The features include points (therefore addresses and locations), line strings (therefore streets, highways and boundaries), polygons (countries, provinces, tracts of land), and multi-part collections of these types. GeoJSON features need not represent entities of the physical world only; mobile routing and navigation apps, for example, might describe their service coverage using GeoJSON.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GeoJSON</strong> is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. It is based on JSON, the JavaScript Object Notation.</p>
<p>The features include points (therefore addresses and locations), line strings (therefore streets, highways and boundaries), polygons (countries, provinces, tracts of land), and multi-part collections of these types. GeoJSON features need not represent entities of the physical world only; mobile routing and navigation apps, for example, might describe their service coverage using GeoJSON.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>GML (Geography Markup Language) is the XML standard of the OGC to represent information of spatial elements. The metadata exchange format is XML (eXtensible Markup Language).</p>
<p>GML was designed based on the abstract specification produced by the OpenGIS group, now Open Geospatial Consortium, and the ISO 19100 document series. GML does not contain specific information on how the visualization of the represented data should be done. For this, styles that are related to GML are used and are described in other XML sublanguages. Other extensions managed by GML include SMIL to define interaction elements and XPointer to represent metadata.</p>
<p>This format is used for the exchange of cadastral data, in addition to the Land Registry in Spain.
There are two formats, both based on the European INSPIRE directive:</p>
<ul>
<li>CP (Cadastral Parcel) for cadastral parcels</li>
<li>BU (Building) for buildings.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the main problems of this trademark language is that there is the impossibility of downloading a GML document from a web service (server) other than that the web application was downloaded. This problem is called Cross-Domain.</p>

<p>This format is used for the exchange of cadastral data, in addition to the Land Registry in Spain.
There are two formats, both based on the European INSPIRE directive:</p>
<ul>
<li>CP (Cadastral Parcel) for cadastral parcels</li>
<li>BU (Building) for buildings.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the main problems of this trademark language is that there is the impossibility of downloading a GML document from a web service (server) other than that the web application was downloaded. This problem is called Cross-Domain.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>GeoPackage is a universal file format for vector and raster spatial data.</p>
<p>It is open, standards-based, and independent of platforms or applications. It has been built on the basis of SQLite, so it uses SQL to use GeoPackage on any desktop or mobile operating system.</p>
<p>The GeoPackage specification describes a set of conventions for storage in a SQLite database of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vector entities.</li>
<li>A set of matrix of tiles of images and raster maps at different scales.</li>
<li>Scheme.</li>
<li>Metadata</li>
<li>Extensions</li>
</ul>
<p>As it is a database, it supports direct use, which means that we can access and update your data in a native storage format without the need for intermediate conversions.</p>
<p>ArcGIS in versions higher than ArcGIS 10.3 and ArcGIS Pro support the reading of Vector GeoPackages.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>GPX or GPS eXchange Format (GPS Interchange Format) is an XML schema designed to transfer GPS data between applications. It can be used to describe points (waypoints), routes (tracks), and routes (routes).</p>
<p>GPX establishes a standard way for the exchange and storage of information
maps on GPS devices, phones, watches and computers. An experienced technician can read a GPX file manually using simple text editing programs; you do not need specialized software to decode the information.</p>
<p>A device saves GPX data as a standard Unicode text file, usually with the GPX extension. The file itself contains data elements encapsulated in XML tags. The GPX specification accommodates any number of points that indicate a path or path, so GPX files can have any size. Simple files with few elements occupy less than 100 Kb. These files are self-contained, so their format requires only one file to describe a complete set of map data.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Personal GeoDatabases were introduced by Esri in ArcGIS for Desktop 8.0 (1999).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Original data format for ArcGIS geodatabases stored and managed in Microsoft Access data files.(This is limited in size and tied to the Windows operating system.)</p>
<p><strong>Number of users</strong>: Single user and small workgroups with smaller datasets: some readers and one writer. Concurrent use eventually degrades for large numbers of readers.</p>
<p><strong>Storage format</strong>: All the contents in each personal geodatabase are held in a single Microsoft Access file (.mdb).</p>
<p><strong>Size limits</strong>: Two GB per Access database. The effective limit before performance degrades is typically between 250 and 500 MB per Access database file.</p>
<p><strong>Versioning support</strong>: Only supported as a geodatabase for clients who post updates using checkout and check-in and as a client to which updates can be sent using one-way replication.</p>
<p><strong>Platforms</strong>: Windows only.</p>
<p><strong>Security and permissions</strong>: Windows file system security.</p>
<p><strong>Database administration tools</strong>: Windows file system management.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: Often used as an attribute table manager (via Microsoft Access). Users like the string handling for text attributes.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/topojson/topojson/wiki/Introduction">From TopoJSON Wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TopoJSON is an extension of GeoJSON. TopoJSON introduces a new type, &quot;Topology&quot;, that contains GeoJSON objects. A topology has an objects map which indexes geometry objects by name. These are standard GeoJSON objects, such as polygons, multi-polygons and geometry collections. However, the coordinates for these geometries are stored in the topology&#39;s arcs array, rather than on each object separately. An arc is a sequence of points, similar to a line string; the arcs are stitched together to form the geometry. Lastly, the topology has a transform which specifies how to convert delta-encoded integer coordinates to their native values (such as longitude &amp; latitude).</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/topojson/topojson/wiki/Introduction">From TopoJSON Wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TopoJSON is an extension of GeoJSON. TopoJSON introduces a new type, &quot;Topology&quot;, that contains GeoJSON objects. A topology has an objects map which indexes geometry objects by name. These are standard GeoJSON objects, such as polygons, multi-polygons and geometry collections. However, the coordinates for these geometries are stored in the topology&#39;s arcs array, rather than on each object separately. An arc is a sequence of points, similar to a line string; the arcs are stitched together to form the geometry. Lastly, the topology has a transform which specifies how to convert delta-encoded integer coordinates to their native values (such as longitude &amp; latitude).</p>

<h1>Data types</h1>
<p>There are two main geographic data types: raster and vector. But there are several raster and vector subtypes based on the information they contain.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Almost every piece data has an spatial component, so we need to understand each data type in order to choose right subtype, storage format, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="../data-storage/odatabase/README.md">geodatabases</a>, a fundamental goal of ArcGIS is to work with numerous file-based data types; DBMS data—including spatial types in the DBMS; and GIS web services from Google, Bing, ArcIMS, and <a href="../../products/arcgis-enterprise/arcgis-server/README.md">ArcGIS for Server</a> and others such as OGC web services. This page will help you to start digging on the spatial data formats supported by ArcGIS.</p>
<p>You will learn ArcGIS allow you to work with a number of data formats from many different sources, here you will find some of those the supported data sources.</p>
<h2>Data types</h2>
<p>Check the <a href="http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/datatypes/about-geographic-data-formats.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_4835793C55C0439593A46FD5BC9E64B9">list of data formats supported in ArcGIS</a> and if you need more you can also use the <a href="http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/datatypes/about-geographic-data-formats.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_17EE0659B23345B9A655752949E49E3E">ArcGIS Data Interoperability extension for Desktop</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to <a href="../data-storage/odatabase/README.md">geodatabases</a>, a fundamental goal of ArcGIS is to work with numerous file-based data types; DBMS data—including spatial types in the DBMS; and GIS web services from Google, Bing, ArcIMS, and <a href="../../products/arcgis-enterprise/arcgis-server/README.md">ArcGIS for Server</a> and others such as OGC web services. This page will help you to start digging on the spatial data formats supported by ArcGIS.</p>
<p>You will learn ArcGIS allow you to work with a number of data formats from many different sources, here you will find some of those the supported data sources.</p>
<h2>Data types</h2>
<p>Check the <a href="http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/datatypes/about-geographic-data-formats.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_4835793C55C0439593A46FD5BC9E64B9">list of data formats supported in ArcGIS</a> and if you need more you can also use the <a href="http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/datatypes/about-geographic-data-formats.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_17EE0659B23345B9A655752949E49E3E">ArcGIS Data Interoperability extension for Desktop</a>.</p>

<p>Raster data types could be classified in many different ways,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Number of spectral bands</strong>: sunlight consist of more wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation than the human eye can see (images are single band or multispectral)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single bands</strong>: grayscale imagery, DEM (Digital Elevation Model), 3D imagery (DTM and DSM)</li>
<li><strong>Multispectral</strong>: NaturalColor, color infrared, NDMI, NDVI, ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Imagery sources</strong> (Sensor platforms):</p>
<ul>
<li>Satellites: Landsat, MODIS, Sentinel, WorldView, ...</li>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The same information used contain different information store as vector data differently.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see an example on what information we can expect to find about a building in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GIS data</strong>: a point or polygon with information about its exact position in the earth, general information like height, antiquity, area, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Lidar data</strong>: a point cloud with very detailed information of the surface of the building.</li>
<li><strong>CAD data</strong>: a set of lines, and points with very detailed information about the distribution of the building.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, based on the tools that where use to collect/generate the information we could differentiate several vector data types. Each data type has it own strengths for the purpose it was build but and the same time can be complementary to other data types.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The vector data model in GIS represents discrete objects on the surface of the earth: roads, rivers, neighborhoods, public lighting, houses, etc. Discrete objects are those that have their limits well defined.</p>
<p>These spatial objects can be represented as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Point</strong>: its spatial geometry consists of a single vertex.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are used for geographical entities that can best be expressed by a single point of reference, such as a specific location of a tree, box or other point of interest.</li>
<li>A point-type object is described by its coordinates X, Y and optionally, Z.</li>
<li>The point is described by attributes such as, for example, a tree or a street lamp.</li>
<li>They can also be used to represent areas on a small scale. For example, cities on a world map will be represented by points instead of polygons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Line or polyline</strong>: its spatial geometry consists of two or more vertices.</p>
<ul>
<li>A polyline is used to show the geometry of linear entities such as roads, rivers, contours, trails, flight paths, etc.</li>
<li>A polyline is a sequence of joined vertices. Each vertex has X and Y coordinates (and optionally Z). The distance can be measured.</li>
<li>The attributes of each polyline describe the properties or characteristics. For example, a road polyline may have attributes that describe whether it is a gravel or tar surface, how many lanes it has, whether it is a road, street, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Polygon</strong>: its spatial geometry consists of four or more vertices and the first and the last is the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>The polygonal entities are closed areas such as dams, islands, administrative areas, etc.</li>
<li>Sequence of joined vertices, where the first and the last are the same. You can measure the area.</li>
<li>The attributes describe each polygon. For example, a land map might have attributes on land uses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing what type of geometry to use depends on the scale, convenience and what you want to do with the data in the GIS.
Most GIS applications do not allow you to mix more than one type of geometry in a single layer.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET Official Documentation</a></p>
<p>ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET contains APIs (for <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/wpf/guide/display-a-map.htm">WPF</a>, <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/uwp/guide/display-a-map.htm">UWP</a>, ...) that enable you to build native mapping apps and share source code across Windows, Android, and iOS. Integrate a range of mapping and GIS capabilities online or offline, including 2D and 3D data visualization, web and mobile maps, editing, geocoding, routing, and spatial analysis.</p>
<p>If you are considering to make an application or prototype as fast as possible (without writing any code), in this case you should also consider using some of <a href="../../../arcgis/products/README.md#app-builders">our app builders, like AppStudio or Survey123</a>.</p>

It is a transport mechanism for maps, their layers, data, networks, and locators. A mobile map package can be sideloaded onto a device by email, or by platform-specific transfer mechanism, or it can be downloaded from a portal to the device. It available for applications developed using ArcGIS Runtime SDK starting with version 100.0.</li>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET Official Documentation</a></p>
<p>ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET contains APIs (for <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/wpf/guide/display-a-map.htm">WPF</a>, <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/uwp/guide/display-a-map.htm">UWP</a>, ...) that enable you to build native mapping apps and share source code across Windows, Android, and iOS. Integrate a range of mapping and GIS capabilities online or offline, including 2D and 3D data visualization, web and mobile maps, editing, geocoding, routing, and spatial analysis.</p>
<p>If you are considering to make an application or prototype as fast as possible (without writing any code), in this case you should also consider using some of <a href="../../../arcgis/products/README.md#app-builders">our app builders, like AppStudio or Survey123</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt</a> is the technology you may want to use if you want to build your Android and iOS applications in C++ &amp; QML.</p>
<p>You also have an IDE to use Qt and QML with several templates, it is called
<a href="appstudio/README.md">App Studio for ArcGIS</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use the <a href="../../../mobile/xamarin/README.md">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET</a> to build cross mobile applications (Android &amp; iOS) using .NET.</p>
<p>As last resource, you may even consider to make an application or prototype as fast as possible (without writing any code), in this case you should also consider using some of <a href="../../../arcgis/products/README.md#app-builders">our app builders, like AppStudio or Survey123</a>.</p>
<p>And remember, before reinventing the wheel <a href="../../../arcgis/mobile-apps/README.md">check the existing Esri mobile apps</a> and consider if it make sense for you to integrate with any of the existings before doing an strong investment.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="http://koopjs.github.io/">Koop</a> is a highly-extensible Javascript toolkit for connecting incompatible spatial APIs. Out of the box <strong>it exposes a Node.js server that can translate GeoJSON into the <a href="https://geoservices.github.io/">Geoservices</a> specification supported by the ArcGIS family of products</strong> (GeoJSON, CSV, KML, Shapefile and Feature Service). Koop can be extended to translate data from any source to any API specification. Don&#39;t let API incompatiblity get in your way, start using one of Koop&#39;s data providers or <a href="https://koopjs.github.io/docs/specs/provider.html">write your own</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="http://koopjs.github.io/">Koop</a> is a highly-extensible Javascript toolkit for connecting incompatible spatial APIs. Out of the box <strong>it exposes a Node.js server that can translate GeoJSON into the <a href="https://geoservices.github.io/">Geoservices</a> specification supported by the ArcGIS family of products</strong> (GeoJSON, CSV, KML, Shapefile and Feature Service). Koop can be extended to translate data from any source to any API specification. Don&#39;t let API incompatiblity get in your way, start using one of Koop&#39;s data providers or <a href="https://koopjs.github.io/docs/specs/provider.html">write your own</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

applications: <a href="#load-time">Load time</a> or <a href="#drawing-features">Drawing features</a>.</p>
<h2>Load time</h2>
<p>You should know that there are a web application called &quot;<a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/jshelp/inside_web_optimizer.html">Web Optimizer</a>&quot;
that generates custom builds of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. The advantage of
using a custom build is that your application downloads and parses only the
required JavaScript resources which will make your application load faster.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Apache Cordova (formerly <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>) is a mobile application development framework originally created by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nitobi-software#/entity">Nitobi</a>. Adobe Systems purchased Nitobi in 2011, rebranded it as PhoneGap, and later released an open source version of the software called Apache Cordova.[3] Apache Cordova enables software programmers to build applications for mobile devices using CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript instead of relying on platform-specific APIs like those in Android, iOS, or Windows Phone.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Did you know that <a href="https://risingstars2016.js.org/">VueJS was the most popular project in 2016</a>?</p>
<p>Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is very easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/android/">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android</a> is the technology you may want to use if you want to build you Android application in Java. If you are interested on building Android applications but not necessarily using this language you could also use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../xamarin/README.md">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET + Xamarin</a>, using C# with Xamarin you can build application which runs on Android, iOS and Windows Phones.</li>
<li><a href="../qt/README.md">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt</a>: using C++ &amp; QML you can also build application for Android and iOS.</li>
</ul>
<p>As last resource, you may even consider to make an application or prototype as fast as possible (without writing any code), in this case you should also consider using some of <a href="../../../arcgis/products/README.md#app-builders">our app builders, like AppStudio or Survey123</a>.</p>
<p>And remember, before reinventing the wheel <a href="../../../arcgis/mobile-apps/README.md">check the existing Esri mobile apps</a> and consider if it make sense for you to integrate with any of the existings before doing an strong investment.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/arcgis-runtime-sdk-for-ios/id1180714771?mt=8">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS Samples</a> is the technology you may want to use if you want to build your iOS application in Swift or Objective-C. If you are interested on building iOS applications but not necessarily using this language you could also use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../xamarin/README.md">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET + Xamarin</a>, using C# with Xamarin you can build application which runs on Android, iOS and Windows Phones.</li>
<li><a href="../qt/README.md">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt</a>: using C++ &amp; QML you can also build application for Android and iOS.</li>
</ul>
<p>As last resource, you may even consider to make an application or prototype as fast as possible (without writing any code), in this case you should also consider using some of <a href="../../../arcgis/products/README.md#app-builders">our app builders, like AppStudio or Survey123</a>.</p>
<p>And remember, before reinventing the wheel <a href="../../../arcgis/mobile-apps/README.md">check the existing Esri mobile apps</a> and consider if it make sense for you to integrate with any of the existings before doing an strong investment.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt</a> is the technology you may want to use if you want to build your Android and iOS applications in C++ &amp; QML.</p>
<p>You also have an IDE to use Qt and QML with several templates, it is called
<a href="../../../desktop/technologies/qt/appstudio/README.md">App Studio for ArcGIS</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use the <a href="../xamarin/README.md">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET</a> to build cross mobile applications (Android &amp; iOS) using .NET.</p>
<p>As last resource, you may even consider to make an application or prototype as fast as possible (without writing any code), in this case you should also consider using some of <a href="../../../arcgis/products/README.md#app-builders">our app builders, like AppStudio or Survey123</a>.</p>
<p>And remember, before reinventing the wheel <a href="../../../arcgis/mobile-apps/README.md">check the existing Esri mobile apps</a> and consider if it make sense for you to integrate with any of the existings before doing an strong investment.</p>

<li>Mobile map package - <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/qml/guide/display-a-map.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_4CCB74E11EE04611849F3C0F41D9381C">QML</a> &amp; <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/cpp/guide/display-a-map.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_4CCB74E11EE04611849F3C0F41D9381C">C++</a>: is a file object (.mmpk) created in ArcGIS Pro. It is a transport mechanism for maps, their layers, data, networks, and locators. A mobile map package can be sideloaded onto a device by email, or by platform-specific transfer mechanism, or it can be downloaded from a portal to the device. It available for applications developed using ArcGIS Runtime SDK starting with version 100.0.</li>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/latest/">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt</a> is the technology you may want to use if you want to build your Android and iOS applications in C++ &amp; QML.</p>
<p>You also have an IDE to use Qt and QML with several templates, it is called
<a href="../../../desktop/technologies/qt/appstudio/README.md">App Studio for ArcGIS</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use the <a href="../xamarin/README.md">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET</a> to build cross mobile applications (Android &amp; iOS) using .NET.</p>
<p>As last resource, you may even consider to make an application or prototype as fast as possible (without writing any code), in this case you should also consider using some of <a href="../../../arcgis/products/README.md#app-builders">our app builders, like AppStudio or Survey123</a>.</p>
<p>And remember, before reinventing the wheel <a href="../../../arcgis/mobile-apps/README.md">check the existing Esri mobile apps</a> and consider if it make sense for you to integrate with any of the existings before doing an strong investment.</p>

<p>ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET provides a common API surface across all supported. This allows you to reuse code and to leverage design patterns such as Model View ViewModel (MVVM). Xamarin Forms provides an excellent framework for cross-platform code sharing, and each API reference includes classes specific to Xamarin Forms. There are some differences between APIs, primarily the inheritance hierarchy for objects built for different platforms.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET</a> is the technology you may want to use if you want to build your Android and iOS applications in .NET.</p>
<p>You can also use the <a href="../qt/README.md">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt</a> to build cross mobile applications (Android &amp; iOS) using C++ &amp; QML.</p>
<p>As last resource, you may even consider to make an application or prototype as fast as possible (without writing any code), in this case you should also consider using some of <a href="../../../arcgis/products/README.md#app-builders">our app builders, like AppStudio or Survey123</a>.</p>
<p>And remember, before reinventing the wheel <a href="../../../arcgis/mobile-apps/README.md">check the existing Esri mobile apps</a> and consider if it make sense for you to integrate with any of the existings before doing an strong investment.</p>
<h2>Training</h2>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/">ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET Official Documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="www.esri.com/training/Bookmark/PKEDPSDGS">Official training</a></li>
</ul>
<p>ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET provides a common API surface across all supported. This allows you to reuse code and to leverage design patterns such as Model View ViewModel (MVVM). Xamarin Forms provides an excellent framework for cross-platform code sharing, and each API reference includes classes specific to Xamarin Forms. There are some differences between APIs, primarily the inheritance hierarchy for objects built for different platforms.</p>

It is a transport mechanism for maps, their layers, data, networks, and locators. A mobile map package can be sideloaded onto a device by email, or by platform-specific transfer mechanism, or it can be downloaded from a portal to the device. It available for applications developed using ArcGIS Runtime SDK starting with version 100.0.</li>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Full motion video Add-in include capabilities for working with motion imagery inside
ArcMap thanks to MISB as you can see in this <a href="http://www.esri.com/videos/watch?videoid=2805&amp;isLegacy=true&amp;title=introduction-to-the-full-motion-video-add_dash_in">short video</a> (5min).</p>
<p>The new Multiplexer geoprocessing tool makes it easy for your
organization to create <a href="http://www.gwg.nga.mil/misb/faq.html">MISB</a> compliant
videos yourself. Just provide previously recorded video and metadata from any
video source, and use the Multiplexer to easily combine them into a new video
file. The result is a MISB compliant video that is fully compatible with the
FMV Add-in and geoprocessing Tools.</p>
<p>You can add a file or an stream source if you plain to work with real time videos.</p>

<p>Full motion video Add-in include capabilities for working with motion imagery inside
ArcMap thanks to MISB as you can see in this <a href="http://www.esri.com/videos/watch?videoid=2805&amp;isLegacy=true&amp;title=introduction-to-the-full-motion-video-add_dash_in">short video</a> (5min).</p>
<p>The new Multiplexer geoprocessing tool makes it easy for your
organization to create <a href="http://www.gwg.nga.mil/misb/faq.html">MISB</a> compliant
videos yourself. Just provide previously recorded video and metadata from any
video source, and use the Multiplexer to easily combine them into a new video
file. The result is a MISB compliant video that is fully compatible with the
FMV Add-in and geoprocessing Tools.</p>
<p>You can add a file or an stream source if you plain to work with real time videos.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.esri.com/arcgis/products/image-server">ArcGIS Image Server</a> allows you to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Raster Analytics</strong>: Raster Analytics quickly extracts information from very large images or image collections. Highly scalable raster analysis models, with distributed computing and storage, get traditionally large and slow analytical tasks done in a fraction of the time. Use Raster Analytics to preserve dynamic imagery as large datasets while analysis tools run, to run multiple analyses on the same imagery, and to maintain data records. Create and run your own job-specific raster analysis models on existing imagery, rasters, and GIS data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Access and Process with Dynamic Image Services</strong>: it provides on-the-fly processing and mosaicking capabilities to make it easy to access both new and existing imagery. On-the-fly processing transforms your source imagery into a wide range of on-demand products, reducing the amount of imagery you need to process and maintain. Dynamic Mosaicking easily handles overlapping imagery to display the most relevant imagery on top.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Share Imagery Products Enterprise-Wide</strong>: Give your entire organization access to imagery—a great interactive source of visual and analytic information. With ArcGIS Image Server, it’s easy to deliver interactive imagery products and provide access to end-users where and how they need it via the entire ArcGIS platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.esri.com/arcgis/products/image-server">ArcGIS Image Server</a> allows you to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Raster Analytics</strong>: Raster Analytics quickly extracts information from very large images or image collections. Highly scalable raster analysis models, with distributed computing and storage, get traditionally large and slow analytical tasks done in a fraction of the time. Use Raster Analytics to preserve dynamic imagery as large datasets while analysis tools run, to run multiple analyses on the same imagery, and to maintain data records. Create and run your own job-specific raster analysis models on existing imagery, rasters, and GIS data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Access and Process with Dynamic Image Services</strong>: it provides on-the-fly processing and mosaicking capabilities to make it easy to access both new and existing imagery. On-the-fly processing transforms your source imagery into a wide range of on-demand products, reducing the amount of imagery you need to process and maintain. Dynamic Mosaicking easily handles overlapping imagery to display the most relevant imagery on top.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Share Imagery Products Enterprise-Wide</strong>: Give your entire organization access to imagery—a great interactive source of visual and analytic information. With ArcGIS Image Server, it’s easy to deliver interactive imagery products and provide access to end-users where and how they need it via the entire ArcGIS platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is ArcGIS Image Server (for <a href="(http://server.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/get-started/windows/what-is-arcgis-image-server-.htm">Windows</a>) | <a href="http://server.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/get-started/linux/what-is-arcgis-image-server-.htm">Linux</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a MOOC for Imagery Analysts: <a href="https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/57aba196cbc441087e0d2395/earth-imagery-at-work/">Earth Imagery at Work</a>.</p>
<h3>Tutorials</h3>
<p>These are not tutorials on <a href="https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/57aba196cbc441087e0d2395/earth-imagery-at-work/">learn.arcgis.com</a> for Imager Server, but there are some for Image Analyst, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Spatial Analyst and 3D Analyst so you can better understand what can be done on <strong>Imagery and Remote Sensing data</strong> in the platform. For example: <a href="https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/assess-burn-scars-with-satellite-imagery/">Assess Burn Scars with Satellite Imagery</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>To <a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/credits.htm">understand the credit system</a> you first need to understand the different <a href="../../../account-types/README.md">account types available in ArcGIS Online</a>.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<h4>What does NOT consume credits?</h4>
<p>Many of what you do with ArcGIS Online does not require service credits including accessing or editing data stored in your layers, using <a href="../../../content/data-providers/README.md">basemaps and imagery</a> layers, exporting your data, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using Esri basemaps in your apps does not consume credits but you are limited to using 1 million <a href="http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/transaction-limits.htm">map transactions</a> per month. Using geosearch in your apps to find a single address does not consume credits but you are limited to 1 million geosearches per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>What consume credits?</h4>
<p>You can use service credits in exchange for storage, analytics, demographics and lifestyle maps. Use <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/pricing/credits/">this chart</a> or visit the <a href="http://links.esri.com/agol-help/credits">documentation</a> page for more information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: there are some credit-consuming operations that can also be performed using free services, such as the <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/geometry-service.htm">sampleserver6.arcgisonline.com geometry REST service</a> or the geometry engine of some APIs/SDKs (JS <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-geometry-geometryEngine.html">geometryEngine</a> &amp; <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-geometry-projection.html">projectionEngine</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>How are credits discounted?</h4>
<p>Credits are discounted periodically (not in real time). (<em>Pending more details</em>)</p>
<h4>How can I avoid to get my account blocked</h4>
<p>Currently there is no foolproof way to prevent your account from being blocked, but there is an <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/account/usage-alerts/">alert mechanism</a> that allows you to set up notifications when you exceed a credit limit (75%, 90%, 100%).</p>
<p>But the most important thing to keep your account from being blocked is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the number of credits an analysis will take.<ul>
<li>Almost every interface using any of the <a href="../rest-apis/ready-to-use-services/README.md">ready to use ArcGIS Online REST APIs</a> have a credit calculator you can check before executing it.</li>
<li>There is also a REST API that can be used programmatically to calculate credit consumption (<a href="../rest-apis/ready-to-use-services/README.md">learn more</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check the number of credits you have left, but remember that they are not updated in real time.</li>
<li>Be careful when using the services that consume credits.</li>
</ul>
<h3>ArcGIS Online Deployment Plan</h3>
<h4>Any plan</h4>
<h5>What is a deployment plan and do I have to pay when I go to production?</h5>
<p>Not necessarily. A deployment plan licenses the use of ArcGIS Online. If your app uses ArcGIS Online, but doesn’t use more than 50 Credits, and doesn’t generate any revenue you may deploy your apps without a paid deployment plan.</p>
<h5>Do I have to choose a deployment plan to sign up?</h5>
<p>No. When you sign up for the ArcGIS Developer Program 50 credits per month are included to develop your applications. You can choose your plan when you go into production or if you need more then 50 credits to develop your application.</p>
<h5>How do I know when my credits will be refilled?</h5>
<p>You can check the <code>Renewal date</code> at <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/organization.html">arcgis.com/home/organization.html</a></p>
<h5>How many MB will take to convert a dataset (CSV, GeoJSON, etc) to a hosted feature service?</h5>
<p><em>PENDING</em></p>
<h5>How hosted featured services are charged?</h5>
<p><em>PENDING</em>: They are charged periodically (every X/hours/...)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note even if you account get blocked, the credits related to featured services will be charged (<em>double check needed</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Free plan (50/monthly credits)</h4>
<p>This is the plan included in the Essentials plan for free.</p>
<h5>What can I do with 50 credits per month?</h5>
<p>You can use your credits on any of our hosted services. If you spent all your credits on any one of the hosted services, you&#39;d be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate 50,000 map tiles</li>
<li>Store 208 MB of features</li>
<li>Store 41 GB of map tiles</li>
<li>Geocode 1,250 addresses</li>
<li>Perform 1,250 simple routes</li>
<li>Perform 100 optimized routes</li>
<li>Perform 100 drive time calculations</li>
<li>Perform 100 closest facility calculations</li>
<li>Perform 25 delivery optimization routes</li>
<li>Enrich your data with 5,000 variables</li>
<li>Check out 4,545 Infographic views</li>
<li>Draw 50,000 demographic maps</li>
<li>Generate 5 demographic reports</li>
<li>Perform spatial analysis on 50,000 features</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#39;re also allowed to view 1,000,000 basemaps per month without consuming any credits.</p>
<h5>What can I do if my account get blocked</h5>
<p>If you are a developer and over exceeded the free 50 monthly credits you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait until next month, your account will be refilled (<a href="#renewal-date">check renewal date</a>) (+50 credits)</li>
<li>Get a paid <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/pricing/credits/">ArcGIS Online Deployment Plan</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important notes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you account will not be reset to 50 credits, if you have less than -50 credits your account will be still blocked.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check the amount of fixed credits been consumed for the hosted feature services, maybe you should remove some (credits related to featured services will be charged (<em>double check needed</em>))</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In some cases it is possible to get a <a href="#vouchers">voucher</a> through your Esri office locally.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Monthly paid plans (200 or more monthly credits)</h4>
<p>There are several <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/pricing/credits/">monthly paid plans</a>: $20/$90/$200/$500/$1000/$2000/$4000 and larger plans available for <a href="(../../../account-types/README.md">developer accounts</a>.</p>
<p>Remember these plans only allow one <a href="../../../account-types/name-users/README.md">level 2 name user</a>. If you need more users you should buy an <a href="../../../account-types/README.md">organization account</a>.</p>
<h5>What if I go over my Deployment Plan limit?</h5>
<p>You can configure your subscription to allow &quot;overages&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>When your monthly subscription runs out of credits you will be charged a little more per credit than your in-plan fee ($.13/credit vs $.10/credit).</li>
<li>You will be billed when you&#39;ve spent $520 worth of credits (4000 credits) or at the next billing period, whichever comes first</li>
<li>You can upgrade your plan at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can configure your subscription NOT to allow &quot;overages&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>When your monthly subscription runs out of credits, your account will be suspended. You can still log in, but your applications will not be allowed to access services that consume credits (such as directions, bulk geocoding, geoenrichment or demographic maps).</li>
<li>At the next billing cycle, you will receive a new batch of monthly credits.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each of the two scenarios above, you can configure your subscription to notify you at, for example, 75%, 90%, 100% of your credit usage.</p>
<p>However, you can also upgrade your plan at any time to avoid overages.</p>
<h5>Can I downgrade my ArcGIS Online Deployment plan to the free plan?</h5>
<p>Not yet, you would have to create a new developer account an migrate everything from your paid account to the free one.</p>
<p>To be able to migrate your content <strong>you will need to have your account unblocked</strong>, only then you can use one of the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ago-assistant.esri.com/">ArcGIS Online Assistant</a> (manually)</li>
<li><a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/python/">ArcGIS API for Python</a> (programmatically)</li>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>To <a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/credits.htm">understand the credit system</a> you first need to understand the different <a href="../../../account-types/README.md">account types available in ArcGIS Online</a>.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<h4>What does NOT consume credits?</h4>
<p>Many of what you do with ArcGIS Online does not require service credits including accessing or editing data stored in your layers, using <a href="../../../content/data-providers/README.md">basemaps and imagery</a> layers, exporting your data, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using Esri basemaps in your apps does not consume credits but you are limited to using 1 million <a href="http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/transaction-limits.htm">map transactions</a> per month. Using geosearch in your apps to find a single address does not consume credits but you are limited to 1 million geosearches per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>What consume credits?</h4>
<p>You can use service credits in exchange for storage, analytics, demographics and lifestyle maps. Use <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/pricing/credits/">this chart</a> or visit the <a href="http://links.esri.com/agol-help/credits">documentation</a> page for more information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: there are some credit-consuming operations that can also be performed using free services, such as the <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/geometry-service.htm">sampleserver6.arcgisonline.com geometry REST service</a> or the geometry engine of some APIs/SDKs (JS <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-geometry-geometryEngine.html">geometryEngine</a> &amp; <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-geometry-projection.html">projectionEngine</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>How are credits discounted?</h4>
<p>Credits are discounted periodically (not in real time). (<em>Pending more details</em>)</p>
<h4>How can I avoid to get my account blocked</h4>
<p>Currently there is no foolproof way to prevent your account from being blocked, but there is an <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/account/usage-alerts/">alert mechanism</a> that allows you to set up notifications when you exceed a credit limit (75%, 90%, 100%).</p>
<p>But the most important thing to keep your account from being blocked is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the number of credits an analysis will take.<ul>
<li>Almost every interface using any of the <a href="../rest-apis/ready-to-use-services/README.md">ready to use ArcGIS Online REST APIs</a> have a credit calculator you can check before executing it.</li>
<li>There is also a REST API that can be used programmatically to calculate credit consumption (<a href="../rest-apis/ready-to-use-services/README.md">learn more</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check the number of credits you have left, but remember that they are not updated in real time.</li>
<li>Be careful when using the services that consume credits.</li>
</ul>
<h3>ArcGIS Online Deployment Plan</h3>
<h4>Any plan</h4>
<h5>What is a deployment plan and do I have to pay when I go to production?</h5>
<p>Not necessarily. A deployment plan licenses the use of ArcGIS Online. If your app uses ArcGIS Online, but doesn’t use more than 50 Credits, and doesn’t generate any revenue you may deploy your apps without a paid deployment plan.</p>
<h5>Do I have to choose a deployment plan to sign up?</h5>
<p>No. When you sign up for the ArcGIS Developer Program 50 credits per month are included to develop your applications. You can choose your plan when you go into production or if you need more then 50 credits to develop your application.</p>
<h5>How do I know when my credits will be refilled?</h5>
<p>You can check the <code>Renewal date</code> at <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/organization.html">arcgis.com/home/organization.html</a></p>
<h5>How many MB will take to convert a dataset (CSV, GeoJSON, etc) to a hosted feature service?</h5>
<p><em>PENDING</em></p>
<h5>How hosted featured services are charged?</h5>
<p><em>PENDING</em>: They are charged periodically (every X/hours/...)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note even if you account get blocked, the credits related to featured services will be charged (<em>double check needed</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Free plan (50/monthly credits)</h4>
<p>This is the plan included in the Essentials plan for free.</p>
<h5>What can I do with 50 credits per month?</h5>
<p>You can use your credits on any of our hosted services. If you spent all your credits on any one of the hosted services, you&#39;d be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate 50,000 map tiles</li>
<li>Store 208 MB of features</li>
<li>Store 41 GB of map tiles</li>
<li>Geocode 1,250 addresses</li>
<li>Perform 1,250 simple routes</li>
<li>Perform 100 optimized routes</li>
<li>Perform 100 drive time calculations</li>
<li>Perform 100 closest facility calculations</li>
<li>Perform 25 delivery optimization routes</li>
<li>Enrich your data with 5,000 variables</li>
<li>Check out 4,545 Infographic views</li>
<li>Draw 50,000 demographic maps</li>
<li>Generate 5 demographic reports</li>
<li>Perform spatial analysis on 50,000 features</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#39;re also allowed to view 1,000,000 basemaps per month without consuming any credits.</p>
<h5>What can I do if my account get blocked</h5>
<p>If you are a developer and over exceeded the free 50 monthly credits you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait until next month, your account will be refilled (<a href="#renewal-date">check renewal date</a>) (+50 credits)</li>
<li>Get a paid <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/pricing/credits/">ArcGIS Online Deployment Plan</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important notes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you account will not be reset to 50 credits, if you have less than -50 credits your account will be still blocked.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check the amount of fixed credits been consumed for the hosted feature services, maybe you should remove some (credits related to featured services will be charged (<em>double check needed</em>))</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In some cases it is possible to get a <a href="#vouchers">voucher</a> through your Esri office locally.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Monthly paid plans (200 or more monthly credits)</h4>
<p>There are several <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/pricing/credits/">monthly paid plans</a>: $20/$90/$200/$500/$1000/$2000/$4000 and larger plans available for <a href="(../../../account-types/README.md">developer accounts</a>.</p>
<p>Remember these plans only allow one <a href="../../../account-types/name-users/README.md">level 2 name user</a>. If you need more users you should buy an <a href="../../../account-types/README.md">organization account</a>.</p>
<h5>What if I go over my Deployment Plan limit?</h5>
<p>You can configure your subscription to allow &quot;overages&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>When your monthly subscription runs out of credits you will be charged a little more per credit than your in-plan fee ($.13/credit vs $.10/credit).</li>
<li>You will be billed when you&#39;ve spent $520 worth of credits (4000 credits) or at the next billing period, whichever comes first</li>
<li>You can upgrade your plan at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can configure your subscription NOT to allow &quot;overages&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>When your monthly subscription runs out of credits, your account will be suspended. You can still log in, but your applications will not be allowed to access services that consume credits (such as directions, bulk geocoding, geoenrichment or demographic maps).</li>
<li>At the next billing cycle, you will receive a new batch of monthly credits.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each of the two scenarios above, you can configure your subscription to notify you at, for example, 75%, 90%, 100% of your credit usage.</p>
<p>However, you can also upgrade your plan at any time to avoid overages.</p>
<h5>Can I downgrade my ArcGIS Online Deployment plan to the free plan?</h5>
<p>Not yet, you would have to create a new developer account an migrate everything from your paid account to the free one.</p>
<p>To be able to migrate your content <strong>you will need to have your account unblocked</strong>, only then you can use one of the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ago-assistant.esri.com/">ArcGIS Online Assistant</a> (manually)</li>
<li><a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/python/">ArcGIS API for Python</a> (programmatically)</li>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>So far Esri has released more than 40 <a href="#apps-developed-by-esri">open source templates</a>
with different purposes: collect/edit data, compare maps/layers,
explore/summarize data, get directions, map social media, provide local
information, showcase 2D or 3D maps, etc.</p>
<p>The best thing is that <strong>you as a developer can write your own templates</strong> (<a href="#training">learn how</a>).</p>
<p>Check the configurable apps Esri has been releasing during the last years:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/13qEcQp7Mh2wQwJmV2EMhj3__qwf7CI26MnEbGHnejSU/pub?w=3539&amp;h=2635"><img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/13qEcQp7Mh2wQwJmV2EMhj3__qwf7CI26MnEbGHnejSU/pub?w=1770&amp;h=1318" alt="Esri configurable apps evolution"></a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>So far Esri has released more than 40 <a href="#apps-developed-by-esri">open source templates</a>
with different purposes: collect/edit data, compare maps/layers,
explore/summarize data, get directions, map social media, provide local
information, showcase 2D or 3D maps, etc.</p>
<p>The best thing is that <strong>you as a developer can write your own templates</strong> (<a href="#training">learn how</a>).</p>
<p>Check the configurable apps Esri has been releasing during the last years:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/13qEcQp7Mh2wQwJmV2EMhj3__qwf7CI26MnEbGHnejSU/pub?w=3539&amp;h=2635"><img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/13qEcQp7Mh2wQwJmV2EMhj3__qwf7CI26MnEbGHnejSU/pub?w=1770&amp;h=1318" alt="Esri configurable apps evolution"></a></p>

<h2>ArcGIS Online Users</h2>
<p>Esri own many ArcGIS Online organizations, and each of them have many users. Some of those users are used for personal use and some of them to publish team work under the same username. So Esri share items by one or another way: using organizations groups or team users.</p>
<p>Here we will focus on team users but you can list User&#39;s groups from their profile (click on: <code>View User&#39;s Groups</code>):</p>

<h2>ArcGIS Online Users</h2>
<p>Esri own many ArcGIS Online organizations, and each of them have many users. Some of those users are used for personal use and some of them to publish team work under the same username. So Esri share items by one or another way: using organizations groups or team users.</p>
<p>Here we will focus on team users but you can list User&#39;s groups from their profile (click on: <code>View User&#39;s Groups</code>):</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>ArcGIS allows you to generate your own 3D models from cadastral track, OSM, lidar, laser, CAD, BIM or even images taken with drones, edit them, symbolize them, perform analysis and share them as a 3D service (in ArcGIS Enterprise or ArcGIS Online), or as a compressed scene layer package, which can be viewed in ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Earth. In the web part remember that we have the scene viewer, templates, Web AppBuilder 3D, and the new JavaScript API 4.3. Using the Javascript API we can create 3D apps with feature service, 3D spatial analysis, dynamic dashboards, filters and ranges, etc.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://3dcampus.arcgis.com/EsriCampusViewer2017/">Campus 3D Viewer</a></li>

<li><a href="http://coolmaps.esri.com/#14">Crime trends</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Videos</h3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>ArcGIS allows you to generate your own 3D models from cadastral track, OSM, lidar, laser, CAD, BIM or even images taken with drones, edit them, symbolize them, perform analysis and share them as a 3D service (in ArcGIS Enterprise or ArcGIS Online), or as a compressed scene layer package, which can be viewed in ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Earth. In the web part remember that we have the scene viewer, templates, Web AppBuilder 3D, and the new JavaScript API 4.3. Using the Javascript API we can create 3D apps with feature service, 3D spatial analysis, dynamic dashboards, filters and ranges, etc.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>What is a community?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A common definition of community emerged as a group of people with diverse characteristics who are linked by social ties, share common perspectives, and engage in joint action in geographical locations or settings. - <em>Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there are many <a href="../../arcgis/README.md">ArcGIS</a> users sharing content and helping each other on many channels, locations, ... Many Esri employees also participate on these communities in their spare time sharing contents, helping other users but also asking questions.</p>
<p>Here you will find a compilation of channels and contents.</p>
<h2>Global communities</h2>
<p>The official channel maintained by Esri for the global community of ArcGIS users is <a href="geonet/README.md">GeoNet</a>, but there are other channel were you will find content generated by the community:</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>What is a community?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A common definition of community emerged as a group of people with diverse characteristics who are linked by social ties, share common perspectives, and engage in joint action in geographical locations or settings. - <em>Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there are many <a href="../../arcgis/README.md">ArcGIS</a> users sharing content and helping each other on many channels, locations, ... Many Esri employees also participate on these communities in their spare time sharing contents, helping other users but also asking questions.</p>
<p>Here you will find a compilation of channels and contents.</p>
<h2>Global communities</h2>
<p>The official channel maintained by Esri for the global community of ArcGIS users is <a href="geonet/README.md">GeoNet</a>, but there are other channel were you will find content generated by the community:</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Machine Learning (ML) refers to a set of data-driven algorithms and techniques that automate the prediction, classification, and clustering of data.</p>
<p>Deep learning refers to a subset of machine learning composed of algorithms that permit software to train itself to perform tasks, like speech and image recognition, by exposing multilayered neural networks to vast amounts of data.</p>

<h1>Precision agriculture</h1>
<p><strong>Precision agriculture</strong> (<strong>PA</strong>), <strong>satellite farming</strong> or <strong>site specific crop management</strong> (<strong>SSCM</strong>) is a farming management concept based on observing, measuring and responding to inter and intra-field variability in crops. The goal of precision agriculture research is to define a decision support system (DSS) for whole farm management with the goal of optimizing returns on inputs while preserving resources. | <em>Source:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_agriculture">wikipedia</a></em>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">From &#39;Geographic information system&#39; at Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, the term describes any information system that integrates, stores, edits, analyzes, shares, and displays geographic information. GIS applications are tools that allow users to create interactive queries (user-created searches), analyze spatial information, edit data in maps, and present the results of all these operations.</p>
