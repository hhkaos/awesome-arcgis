Awesome list for ArcGIS Developers Awesome resource list for ArcGIS Developers Table of contents Quick overview Getting started About ArcGIS Contributions ArcGIS community Localized resources lists Quick overview No matter your background or your favourite technology, we have putted together many links to help you find tools, code samples, training, and help you get started with ArcGIS. Start check the section that best matches with you: Front-end developer Back-end developer Mobile developer Desktop developer DevOps Virtual reality developers In order help you better understand the technology we have also collected some links to introduce you to the content you have available in the platform and which are the benefits of developing using ArcGIS. This diagram displays an overview of the technologies available for ArcGIS developers: Getting started You can sign up for free in order to be able to: Download some tools: the SDKs for mobile or desktop developers, Web AppBuilder Developer Edition, etc. Store data in ArcGIS Online Use de ArcGIS Online Web Map Editor Build Web Maps Use the ready to use services etc. Know more about the developer plans. About ArcGIS ArcGIS is a 360º software platform built by Esri and it already have more than 100 software tools. Many of those tools are end-user software like desktop applications or mobile Applications but there are also many tools for developers and devops as you will see in this awesome list of resources. About Esri Esri (Environmental Systems Research Institute) was founded in 1969 by Jack and Laura Dangermond. Today it software ( ArcGIS ) is been used by a 40% of the global market. The company have more than 350000 customers worldwide, 8000 employees, 1600 partners, 90 offices and $1.1B on revenue. It organize multiple events annually and the biggest one (the User Conference in San Diego) brings together more than 15000 users. There is also a developer focused event, the Developer Summit, it take place at Palm Springs (USA) and Berlin (EU) every year. Check this diagram to know more about the GIS and Esri evolution: If you want to know more about ArcGIS capabilities, features, ... we encourage you to can start checking some of these sites: ArcGIS capabilities: spatial analysis, real time, big data, 3D, imagery and sensors, etc. ArcGIS features: content ready to use, visualization, spatial analysis, team administrations, apps, tools for developers, etc. ArcGIS patterns: analysis and planification, operational awareness, field data collection, assets management and community engagement. How GIS works: five steps: ask, collect, examine, analyze and act. Contributions Please feel free to contribute to this list. The technology change fast and some resources may be out to date.

Work offline Table of contents Developer technologies Native apps Web apps Patterns Services pattern Desktop pattern Conflicts Contributions Each day we realize that been able to work offline with our mobile, tablet or desktop devices is more important, that why we offer you the chance to build applications that could work with maps & GIS without internet connection. There are many options to solve problems when you need apps to work offline, here you will find many of those. Developer technologies Native apps If you are a mobile developer or a desktop developer you have all our native Runtimes and SDKs and some builders to build you own custom apps. In case you are not a developer or you want to build an app quickly you also have AppStudio Standard and Survey123 that will help you build offline apps. And in case you don't need to but to build a custom or branded app you may also consider to use Collector for ArcGIS. Web apps But if you are a web developer and you don't need a powerful GIS SDK to build app you can also build it using phonegap. We also encourage you to take a look to the offline-editor-js project which is an ArcGIS JavaScript library for handling offline editing and tiling. If you are looking for a responsive app to collect points oflline you could take a look to GeoForm, a web app which can make the job (but it offline functionality is limited). If you don't know already, you should learn about progressive web apps in order to be learn how to build reliable, fast and engaging apps even when you have no Internet connection. Google is doing a great job spreading the word about it benefits. Check the videos at the Proggressive Web App Summit 2016 Prepare content to be consumed offline When you are developing an offline app you can follow two main patterns: Services pattern: Best for supporting a large number of users, this pattern allows multiple offline users to edit the same data layers and sync edits later, when online. Desktop pattern: Best for supporting applications with read-only data that requires periodic updates. Take maps offline with ArcGIS Online Patterns Services pattern The services pattern is best for supporting a large number of users. This pattern allows multiple offline users to edit the same data layers and sync edits later, when online. For operational data, you can use a sync-enabled feature service from ArcGIS for Server, ArcGIS Online, or Portal for ArcGIS to generate the geodatabase for offline use. Through the synchronization process, you can control whether a user can upload their changes, download others' changes, or both. This allows the application to have an up-to-date view of the data. When more than one user is editing the same feature and the edits conflict, the last edit synchronized to the service overrides the others. In one workflow, sometimes referred to as a pre-planned workflow, you generate the geodatabase once and load it onto your users' devices. This workflow requires you to register a geodatabase. For basemap data, ArcGIS tiled map services and ArcGIS Online basemaps allow for the on-demand creation of tile caches, letting you take your basemaps offline. Create a basemap from a tiled service (download a basemap): An offline copy of tiled map services can be requested so that a basemap is available when the application is working in an offline environment. These copies can be downloaded in the form of a tile package (.tpk file) or compact cache by using the API. Desktop pattern This is the best for supporting applications with read-only data that requires periodic updates. You can use ArcGIS for Desktop to include features, tabular data, tile caches, network datasets for directions and locators in your offline app. Learn more: Create ArcGIS Runtime content using ArcGIS Desktop To include operational data in your offline app generate a geodatabase (using ArcGIS for Desktop). Create a basemap using ArcGIS for Desktop: When you create a basemap using ArcGIS for Desktop, you can set the format, tiling schemes, and levels of detail. For details, see the online ArcGIS help topics How to create a tile package and About tile packages.

Front-end developers Table of contents Introduction to ArcGIS API Getting started Web mapping history More resources Contributions Introduction to ArcGIS API ArcGIS Javascript API is built in top of Dojo Toolkit because it was the first technology allowing to load dependencies in an asynchronous way (using AMD) as many other modern libraries are doing today (JSConfUS 2013: Dojo already did that). Getting started If you are one of those who do not like reading and prefer to learn by looking at code, visit: esri-es.github.io/arcgis-web-samples. If you are still reading ... go to \"Technologies\" to learn how to combine ArcGIS JS API with almost any other framework/library. Do not forget to read the best practices in order to get the most of ArcGIS. About pricing: There is no technical restrictions that avoid you to start building web applications without signing up, but in order to be able to take the advantage of using custom vector maps, store geolocated data, use webmaps, use the smart-mapping tools, use some ready to use services, etc we recommend you to sign up for a free account.

Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is very easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.
