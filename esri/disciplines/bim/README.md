## Introduction
A new collaboration between [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/bim/hub/autodesk-esri) and Esri will put GIS and BIM at the center of construction projects, driving smarter decisions, optimized designs, accelerated project approvals, reduced cost, creating smarter cities and resilient infrastructure. Building the bridge between GIS and BIM will change the way we plan, design, and build our future ([more info](http://www.esri.com/landing-pages/autodesk-esri-strategic-alliance)).

## Community

If you need help you should probably go to the [3D group on GeoNet](https://community.esri.com/community/gis/3d) and mention one of the experts on GeoNet.

You might also find some Q&As on [Stackexchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/search?q=bim).

### People you should know

Please find the [ArcGIS Experts on this topic using this tool](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=BIM):

[![ArcGIS Experts Tool Screenshot](https://github.com/esri-es/arcgis-experts/blob/master/assets/imgs/arcgis-experts-tool.png?raw=true)](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=BIM)

They don't work on the support team and some may even not work at Esri,
but they are opening some projects and sharing insights related to this
technology so we recommend you to follow them.

## News

* [News about BIM at blogs.esri.com](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/tag/bim/)
