## Introduction

Machine Learning (ML) refers to a set of data-driven algorithms and techniques that automate the prediction, classification, and clustering of data.

Deep learning refers to a subset of machine learning composed of algorithms that permit software to train itself to perform tasks, like speech and image recognition, by exposing multilayered neural networks to vast amounts of data.

## Training

### Tutorials

* Machine Learning Tutorial: [Predict Seagrass Habitats](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/predict-seagrass-habitats-with-machine-learning/) using [ArcGIS Pro](../../../arcgis/products/arcgis-desktop/arcgis-pro/README.md).


### Videos

We have created a [Artificial Intelligence Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLahIW2YFPQd4hfpWLy5rGDqCxNbx-qDHH) that we think it might be worth to you to save ([how to save a Youtube Playlist](../../../assets/SavePlaylist.gif)).

### People you should know

Please find the [ArcGIS Experts on this topic using this tool](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?showAll=true&topic=Machine%20Learning):

[![ArcGIS Experts Tool Screenshot](https://github.com/esri-es/arcgis-experts/blob/master/assets/imgs/arcgis-experts-tool.png?raw=true)](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?showAll=true&topic=Machine%20Learning)

They don't work on the support team and some may even not work at Esri,
but they are opening some projects and sharing insights related to this
technology so we recommend you to follow them.
