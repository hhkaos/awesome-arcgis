# Virtual Reality Developers
Export 3D scenarios built using [City Engine](../../../arcgis/products/city-engine/README.md), export them to [Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine) and build your application using any VR SDK to finish the application for your [VR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality) [headset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset).

## Introduction

This video can help you understand what can be done with ArcGIS and virtual.

To build you own applications using ArcGIS scenarios you first need to build the
scenario using [City Engine](../../../arcgis/products/city-engine/README.md) and then you will be able to export it and consume it using Unity.

## Training

To be able to build your own VR applications using ArcGIS scenarios you should learn about City Engine and Unity:

* Awesome list: [City Engine](../../../arcgis/products/city-engine/README.md)

## People you should know
Please find the ArcGIS Experts (story tellers and developers) on this topic here: [https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=Virtual%20Reality%20(VR)](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=Virtual%20Reality%20(VR))

They don't work on the support team and some may even not work at Esri,
but they are opening some projects and sharing insights related to this
technology so we recommend you to follow them.
