## Introduction

ArcGIS can be used to develop games but also to build game scenarios as you will find on this page.

## Awesome projects and cool demos

Many of this demos are available at the [Esri's Prototype Lab Portal](https://maps.esri.com/portal/WebApps/index.html) and the [Esri UK Map Labs team](https://maplabs.github.io/).

### Educational games / Serious games

* [Name that landmark](https://github.com/maplabs/name-that-landmark): The aim of the game is to guess a location from aerial imagery by scratching off a panel obscuring it. The more that is scratched the less a player scores. A player also scores less points the longer they take to name the location.

* [A Game of Geodesics](https://maps.esri.com/jg/GeodesicsGame/index.html): Find the location that is equidistant to three random cities

* [Pin-tail](http://bit.ly/2lbwiuv): Pin the tail on the map is inspired by the well known party game 'pin the tail on the donkey'

* Interactive Puzzles ([Europe ](http://thinkmaps.github.io/Puzzle/index_en.html), [U.S. States](http://thinkmaps.net/puzzleus/index.html), [Portugal ](http://62.28.34.124/PuzzlePortugal/index_en.html) & [Brazil ](https://github.com/ezequias/PuzzleBrazil)): Drag the countries from the right side to the right position on the map.
