# Configurable web apps

[Configurable apps](http://www.esri.com/software/configurable-apps) is a
mechanism that allows users of an organization to create and configure
**web applications** without having to write any code.

There are more than 40 templates with different purposes: collect/edit data,
compare maps/layers, explore/summarize data, get directions, map social media,
provide local information, showcase 2D or 3D maps, etc.

This templates can be built for anyone, but Esri use to release new configurable
apps, here you can see an evolution:

[ArcGIS Online](../../../arcgis/products/arcgis-online) and
[Portal for ArcGIS](../../../arcgis/products/arcgis-enterprise/portal-for-arcgis)

## Story maps
Those applications which are design to tell a story are called
[**storymaps**](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/). You can check a full list of
them [here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/app-list/).
