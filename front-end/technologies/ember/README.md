## People you should know
Please find the ArcGIS Experts (story tellers and developers) on this topic here: [https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=EmberJS](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=EmberJS)

They don't work on the support team and some may even not work at Esri,
but they are opening some projects and sharing insights related to this
technology so we recommend you to follow them.
