## Introduction

Apache Cordova (formerly [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/)) is a mobile application development framework originally created by [Nitobi](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nitobi-software#/entity). Adobe Systems purchased Nitobi in 2011, rebranded it as PhoneGap, and later released an open source version of the software called Apache Cordova.[3] Apache Cordova enables software programmers to build applications for mobile devices using CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript instead of relying on platform-specific APIs like those in Android, iOS, or Windows Phone.

## Training
* [Choosing the Right Esri API](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/guides/choosing-the-right-platform/)
* [Using PhoneGap tutorial with ArcGIS API for JS 3.x](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/jshelp/inside_phonegap.html)
* [Using PhoneGap tutorial with ArcGIS API for JS 4.x](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/using-phonegap/)


## Code

Github repos:
  * [ArcGIS JavaScript samples for use with PhoneGap/Cordova](https://github.com/Esri/quickstart-map-phonegap)
  * [Ionic app demonstrating how to use the Esri ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://github.com/jwasilgeo/ionic-esri-map): Ionic lets developers build beautiful and interactive mobile apps using HTML5 and AngularJS. Since Ionic is an HTML5 framework, it needs a native wrapper like Cordova or PhoneGap in order to run as a native app ([read more](http://ionicframework.com/docs/overview/)).
